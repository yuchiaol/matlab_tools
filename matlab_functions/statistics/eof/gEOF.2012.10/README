gEOF User Guide


1. To run the example script:

- Extract all files in gEOF.tar to a directory.
- Start Matlab from that directory.
- Run the example script "gEOF_example".
- Find the results in ./output (.dat and .ctl files in GrADS format).


2. To work with your own data:

- Prepare binary data file (*.dat) in GrADS format.
- Prepare specification file (.spec); see illustration below.
- Edit gEOF.m as appropriate.
- Run "gEOF" in Matlab.


3. Specification file format:

a b c
d e f
g h i

a: missing value flag

c: reserved for future use
d: # of zonal points
e: longitude of westernmost zonal point
